Maths (as Physics) never came to me as naturally as to my colleagues. I always had a hard time understanding basically everything, and the abstraction used to drive me crazy.

But I always loved Astronomy, I always loved the sky, the stars, the sensation of how little we are and how marvelous nature is.

So, when I was 16, I took a deep breath and admitted what was long known to my soul: I'd get a degree in Physics.

Little did I know my passion for science was starting to bloom.

It wasn't easy. In fact, I felt (and this must be a recurring feeling among students of all levels) I had the hardest time, studied long hours, and still, I got lower grades. But I endured.

I tried being an academic. I started doing research on Astrophysics (specifically, the detection of "new-born" starts through infrared radiation), but it was too slow for me: it takes literally billions of years for something to happen when we're talking about Astrophysics (except Supernovas).

So that was it, I loved what I studied, but I saw no future doing pure research for me. I had to look for something else, and that's how I got to financial markets, and that's what I'm going to talk about next.
