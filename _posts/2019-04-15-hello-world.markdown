This is the second time I deploy my website, but the first one was just a landing page with links to my social media accounts. This time I decided to use `jekyll`, and I was super scared because I'm not familiar to Ruby at all. But! I wasn't that complex.

I decided also to write more on this blog about my journey as a data scientist.

Check out the [Jekyll docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll.
